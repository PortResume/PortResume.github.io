    <h1><i> How We Met </i> </h1>
    <h3><i> OPENING DAY FOR LOVE
 </i> </h3>
    <p><i>Opening Day of the Orioles, in a bar, by a window. Sara approached Skylar that day while her friends were in the bathroom. It was a bold move, but there was something that was pulling her towards him. They chatted, and funny enough discovered that Sara's ex boyfriend was Skylar's wrestling competitor in high school. After about 30 minutes someone mentioned Skylar's... GIRLFRIEND?! Sara left immediately, thinking she'd never see him again. They hadn't even exchanged names.

Fast forward a few days and Sara got a Facebook message from the one and only- Skylar. Ah, that was his name. Skylar had stalked Sara's ex-boyfriends Facebook in order to find her. She was flattered, a true modern romantic. They chatted a little here and there. He still had a girlfriend, she wasn't interested.

Mid September Sara gets a text... "Can I take you to dinner?" .. "Do you still have a girlfriend?" ... "No"

They went out for pizza and beer at Pub Dog. That pub around the corner that was about to hold so many memories for them. Just one month later they were back in that pub, and Skylar told Sara that he loved her. And he told her that was the last first time he would ever say that to someone.</i>
    </p><br>
   <h1><i> Popin' the Q </i> </h1>
    <h3><i> SKYLAR F!@#$%^&*() UP
 </i> </h3>
    <p><i>.. But ended up killin' it!

The proposal was supposed to take place Christmas Eve. But silly Skylar asked Sara to check an email for him, in the same inbox he was chatting with her best friend about the PROPOSAL. Sara's friend clued him in that she knew, and he was left to think quick on his feet!

That's when a spontaneous trip to NYC with a size 12 gold band (because Sara's rings weren't ready yet), was put into action.

Strolling around the iconic Central Park, Skylar popped the question atop a formation of rocks overlooking the park. It was beautiful, it was romantic, and the ring was way too big. It was the perfect proposal, it was so Skylar and Sara.</i>
